    "about": "Hey, I'm Vardan. I've got an M.Tech in Software Engineering from BITS Pilani and over 8 years of experience building full-stack products, setting up cloud infrastructure, and integrating AI into real workflows. My go-to stack is Python, Django, Node.js, and FastAPI. Every project I touch gets containerized on day one, goes through proper CI/CD, and lands on AWS or GCP. I've also been working a lot with LLMs, RAG pipelines, and AI agents lately, putting them into actual production systems (not just demos). Outside of coding, I consult with startups, teach developers, and love collaborating on interesting problems. I genuinely believe good engineers lift others up, not just build cool tech.",
