    "about": "I'm Vardan Verma — a full-stack engineer with an M.Tech in Software Engineering from BITS Pilani. I specialize in backend architecture, cloud infrastructure, and practical AI integration. I build primarily with Python, Django, Node.js, and FastAPI, treating every project with a DevOps-first mindset: containerized from day one, version-controlled, and shipped through automated CI/CD pipelines on AWS and GCP. Beyond writing code, I actively deploy LLMs, RAG pipelines, and multi-step AI agents into real production workflows. I also consult, teach, and collaborate — I believe the best engineers invest in the people around them as much as the systems they build.",
