    "about": "I'm Vardan Verma — a full-stack engineer with a focused approach to backend architecture, cloud infrastructure, and practical AI integration. I build primarily with Python, Django, Node.js, and FastAPI, and I treat every project with a DevOps-first mindset: containerized from day one, version-controlled, and shipped through automated CI/CD pipelines on AWS and GCP. Beyond writing code, I actively research and deploy LLMs, RAG pipelines, and multi-step AI agents into real production workflows — reducing manual overhead and enabling teams to move faster. I care about clean architecture, observable systems, and solutions that hold up under production load."
